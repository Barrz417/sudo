# sudo

[`sudo`](https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/sudo) stands for *superuser do*. It is a wrapper script to execute commands as the `root (superuser)` user in the [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) app, like to drop to an interactive shell for any of the supported shells, or to execute shell script files or their text passed as an argument.
